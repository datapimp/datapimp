### Tools for working with common data sources

A collection of CLI utilities for pulling both files and structured data
from file sharing and collaboration services like Google Drive and
Dropbox.

You can use this to pull down google spreadsheets and convert them to
JSON structures, or to convert an excel spreadsheet on Dropbox to the
same.

You can use this to sync the contents of a local folder on your system
with the remote contents of a file share on Dropbox or Google Drive.

And much more.

### Getting Started

gem install datapimp

```
